#### Revealing and Mitigating the Spread of Harmful Content in Recommender Systems  

This is the resource of our work "Revealing and Mitigating the Spread of Harmful
Content in Recommender Systems" which aims to investigate recommender systems from the harmfulness perspective. 

This resource includes:

**Three constructed datasets** with harmfulness-related information under "Benchmarks" path;

**Two harmfulness-related metrics** proposed to quantitatively evaluate the harmfulness of recommendation results under "HarmfulnessMetrics" path.

**A novel framwork MitiHarm**, which is a generic and model-agnostic framework that can be seamlessly integrated into existing models to promote healthy content dissemination, under "MitiHarm_code" path.

More details about these resources can be found in the "readme.md" files in each path.

By providing this resource, we seek to raise awareness of potential risks associated with recommender systems and provide a foundation for building more responsible, harmfulness-aware approaches.
